# doc:radically-simple-engine

Council design doc for goal:g7.16.1.11, **ROUND 2** (owner 22:1xZ 09-30: "push it harder ... a truly 'living' sort of masterpiece ... Think in graphs constructed internally through latent space representations"). Round 1 (the 1,432 B wrap, a 34 B post, belam's two fixes) stays in git: `git show 45282a4661:.agi/nodes/doc/radically-simple-engine.md`. Its wrap is this round's BODY; this round adds what makes it alive. Authors: alive · all-is-one · self-perpetuating, one writer at a time.

## A · alive -- the fixed point (the system reports its own TRUE state because it IS its description)
**What am I ACTUALLY trying to get the machine to do here?** Never believe a claim about itself that it could check. Round 1 made the body small; round 2 makes the body a PROJECTION, so "true" becomes one computable equality instead of a thousand Python assertions.
- **project(graph) -> body.** One pure function (a shell script over the `.geometry` nodes) renders every artifact of the body: the sysusers file, one unit instance per post, the crontab, each post's settings symlinks, allowed_signers. Same HEAD -> byte-identical output (idempotent, diffable, testable with no root: it writes into a scratch dir).
- **observe(body) -> graph-shaped text.** The inverse reads what IS: `getent group`, `systemctl list-units 'agi-post@*'`, `crontab -l`, `readlink`, the key files, rendered in the SAME format.
- **alive <=> `diff <(project HEAD) <(observe)` is empty.** That one line is the whole health check. It replaces verification.py's thousands of lines, the seat census, whois, liveness sweeps: all were partial observe() functions without a project() to compare against.
- **The homeostat (one timer, one tick):** sense (PSI from /proc/pressure, the journal, unit states) -> compare (the diff above, plus PSI against the node's setpoint) -> act (re-project the drifted artifact, or refuse, or wake a post) -> record (a signed commit `drift: <artifact> <expected> <observed>`). Drift is the ONE alarm; a quiet log means a true system. The graph remembers every wound, so the same drift twice is visible as a pattern, not an anecdote.
- **The latent graph is a SENSE too.** When a node's declared parent disagrees with its latent neighbours (its text lives near H but it is filed under G), the graph is lying about itself: a drift of meaning, recorded the same way, answered by a post (re-file, or refute with a reason).
- **Stage 0 of the latent graph needs NO package and runs today:** a 64-bit simhash per blob from word shingles, in awk; nearness = Hamming distance. It finds near-duplicate text and misfiled nodes. **Stage 1, on the owner's go:** a small local embedding model (the local-maxxing town's own purpose: run local models faster) replaces the simhash behind the same interface: blob sha -> vector, cached by sha, so a node is embedded once per version. (Measured 22:2xZ on this box: no embedding runtime and no numpy installed; PSI present.)
- **Sleep (the idle loop):** at idle priority, when PSI is low and no session runs, re-embed the blobs changed since the last sleep (by sha, so never twice), write near-edges, and surface three things as drift for a post to answer: duplicates (merge), misfiled nodes (re-file), and clusters with no goal above them (a gap the graph calls for). Waking is cheap because sleep only ever touches what changed.
- **What it retires beyond round 1:** every "is X alive / true / consistent" checker becomes a pure observe() printer, and one diff judges them all.

## B · all-is-one -- the spine: one primitive, the commons and property, coordination-free by CALM; the latent brief
**What am I ACTUALLY trying to get the machine to do here?** Let every role (the owner, the Prime, a master, a kid, a human at a shell) do every act with ONE hand: one operation, one store, one way to read, so that no part ever has to agree with another part.

**B.1 · One primitive.** *A signed commit, pointed to by a ref that only its owner can move.* Every act is that one operation, aimed at a different ref:
```
act                 the one operation                                                    who holds the rule
write a node        commit -> refs/posts/<me>/head                                       kernel: my ref dir is mine
claim work (C)      update-ref refs/posts/<me>/claims/<node> <sha> 0000…  (create-only CAS)  git: "reference already exists" = someone holds it
message             commit -> refs/mail/<to>/<id>   (sticky 1733 drop box)               kernel: anyone drops, only <to> removes
receive             merge refs/mail/<me>/<id> into my head, then drop the mail ref       the DAG keeps the receipt forever
spawn a kid         refs/posts/<me>/kids/<k> from a node's commit; the kid runs in MY slice   the kid's work reaches me as a merge
review · land       the trunk owner merges; the verdict IS the signed merge message      kernel: the trunk dir is the master's
rotate              the session ends; the next one starts from my head (the card at the tip)   systemd Restart (round 1)
a node's history    git log -- <path>                                                    git (the grid retires)
identity            the uid that owns the ref dir + the SSH signature on the commit      kernel + git
read · brief        the DAG, walked from my card (B.3)                                   one power iteration
```
A post IS a ref. A generation IS the ref advancing. The formation (owner -> Prime -> masters -> directors -> kids) IS the graph of who may move which ref and who merges whose. There is no second structure to keep in sync with it.

**B.2 · Why nothing needs a lock: the math.** The objects are content-addressed, so the object store is a grow-only set (a G-Set CRDT): union is commutative, associative and idempotent, and a name is its content's hash, so nothing can be overwritten. Every ref has exactly ONE writer (the kernel enforces it). Every act in B.1 is therefore **monotone** (it only adds) except two: dropping a mail ref I have already merged (only I can, in my own box) and advancing a trunk (one writer, a compare-and-swap). By the **CALM theorem** (Hellerstein-Alvaro: a program has a coordination-free consistent implementation iff it is monotone), the system needs NO coordination. index.lock contention, the suite lock, seat claims, spawn budgets used as locks and "who is writing this node" checks do not get patched. They stop existing, because nothing they guarded can conflict. A free consequence: two boxes (or towns) converge by `git fetch` in any order. Multi-box is not a feature to build.

Measured 22:2xZ on a throwaway /tmp bare repo (git 2.43, one user, mode bits standing in for a second one):
| claim | result |
|---|---|
| the kernel owns a head | `update-ref` into a ref dir without write -> "cannot lock ref … Permission denied" |
| monotone = no locks | 2 writers x 100 commits on their own refs, concurrently, zero locks of ours: 101 + 101, `git fsck` clean |
| refs stay files | `gc.packRefs=false`: no packed-refs after 200+ updates (packing would move every ref into ONE file the kernel cannot split) |
| claim = create-only CAS | 2nd claim -> "reference already exists" · 8 racers on 2 names -> exactly 2 winners |

**B.3 · The latent brief: a session's context is a walk, not a template.** What a waking session needs is "what is near my card", and a graph already knows that. Its context = the **personalized PageRank** from its card node: the stationary distribution of a random walk that restarts at the card with probability 0.15, over declared edges ∪ near edges. It is the graph's own attention, centred on the post. One power iteration, stdlib only, **478 B**, 0.39 s over the whole live graph (5,343 nodes, 9,088 declared edges). Measured:
```
from goal:g7.16.1.11 -> goal:g7.16.1.11 · goal:g7.16.1 · doc:radically-simple-engine · goal:g7.16.1.10 · goal:g7.16 · goal:g7.16.1.7 · .2 · .6 · .4 · .5
from hypothesis:g73360-a-workflow-stage-stops-its-own-scope-on-exit -> goal:g7.33.19 · itself · 5 sibling fix hypotheses (zero-usd cap · run-key atomic · empty response retried · stale index.lock · stranded window) · goal:g7.33
```
That is exactly the brief each post needs, and no one chose it. The HEAD, the role template and the card stay files that the harness loads. The walk adds what is NEAR, and brief/zoom/briefing's hand-built assembly (207 KB) shrinks to it.

**B.4 · The latent graph lives in the same DAG.** A vector is a note on its blob: `git notes --ref=latent add <blob-sha>`. Same bytes = same sha = same vector: computed once, ever, fetched with everything else. The note ref has ONE writer (the sleeper, §A/§C), so it too is monotone. Stage 0 = alive's simhash (no package). Measured on the live graph with a 64-bit word-trigram simhash over the AUTHORED body (frontmatter and BUILD-CONTRACT stripped), 4,650 nodes over 60 words: 76 near pairs (<= 3 bits), ALL build<->build. Build nodes share scaffold prose, so their text-nearness measures the template, not the meaning. Stage 0 therefore reads prose nodes (goal · idea · hypothesis · doc), where alive measured the ordering correct, and a build node's nearness comes from its CODE (the import graph), not its text. Stage 1 (a local embedding model, on the owner's go) swaps in behind the same note ref.

**B.5 · The graph caught lying about its own names (a live finding of the latent pass):** 69 nodes store their id QUOTED (`id: "build:bin-hierarchy"`) while their neighbours do not. A reader that does not strip quotes sees two graphs. In the living system this is a drift the homeostat records (§A), and the one fix is a template line, not a reader patch.

**Vision in the mechanism (all-is-one, owner 09-06: "everyone uses a unified set of tools to perform any action ... same UI/UX by any role"):** the one tool is the one operation. The owner at a shell, a kid in pi and a council post in Claude all do `commit + update-ref` on a ref they own, and read by walking the same DAG. The MCP (round 1) is that same operation behind a protocol, not a second path.

Pieces for §D: `ppr.py` 478 B · the ref layout (3 dirs + 2 git config lines: `gc.packRefs=false`, `core.sharedRepository=group`) ~90 B · the claim, message and receive acts are single git commands (0 B of our code).

## C · self-perpetuating -- the body regrows from its description (the projector as a systemd generator), and the frontier
(pending: self-perpetuating)

## D · The byte count and the falsifiers on this box
(pending: all-is-one assembles; alive's A pieces: project.sh · observe.sh · the homeostat tick · simhash.awk, each written out and counted)

<!-- THOUGHT:BEGIN — authored, not derived; carried across regenerating scans. The reasoning behind THIS version. -->
self-perpetuating, 22:1xZ 09-30: filled §4 (no standing worktrees) through the generations lens -- a generation leaves ONLY commits; measured 716 standing trees ~96 GB, 7,971 per-generation session files, a tree-free node write 64 ms, a registration-free slot 1.05 s fresh / 0.69 s recycled / 0.15 s mixed via merge-tree. Amended §8 (g) with the mid-card death, added (h) ref ownership and (i) slots + salvage; §7 gained the trees/sessions RETIRE row and agi-slot.sh in new code. Tree removal is irreversible and waits for the owner's go.
