testable_claim: a stale index.lock (older than values.core.stale_index_lock_s, no live git holder) is removed with a named line before the round commit; a fresh or held one refuses by name; a failed round commit exits non-zero and the harvest dm names it

# hypothesis:a-stale-index-lock-is-cleared-or-named-and-a-failed-round-commit-is-never-silent

## Measured
goal:g7.33.19 row 18: DH.503's round worktree held a 0-byte `.git/.../index.lock` (04:01:16Z, no holder); the parent's round commit failed and the parent exited with the kid's work uncommitted and unreviewed; 4 more kid worktrees held one at 04:24Z. No engine code handles index.lock (`grep -n index.lock extensions/agi/bin/*.py` = 0 hits). The round commit (cli.py:2511-2520) prints `ERR: worktree commit failed` to stderr and returns None; the harvest line the director receives does not say the commit failed.

## CLAIM
(1) Before the round commit, a STALE index.lock -- older than the cell values.core.stale_index_lock_s AND no live git process working in that checkout -- is removed with ONE named line, and the commit proceeds; a lock that is fresh or held is never removed: the commit refuses BY NAME. (2) A failed round commit is never silent: the done path exits non-zero and the parent's harvest dm to its director carries `commit FAILED: <reason>`.

## Dispatch line
config-max: values.core.stale_index_lock_s in .agi/config.json (the staleness threshold) / template-max: the harvest-dm line gains the commit-failed field in its template, if one exists / code: the stale-lock check before the commit + the non-zero exit (the trigger that does not exist)

## FALSIFIERS
a held or fresh lock removed · a stale lock left and the commit failing silently · a failed commit with exit 0 · the threshold a literal in code

## TESTS
one new test file, tmp git repos only: a stale 0-byte index.lock older than the cell -> removed, named, commit lands; a fresh lock -> refused by name, exit non-zero, lock untouched; a commit that fails for another reason -> non-zero + the failure named; plus test_cli.py test_dispatch.py test_bin_help_smoke.py once (timeout 900, --basetemp under /tmp)

## FILE SCOPE
extensions/agi/bin/cli.py (the round commit + cmd_done's exit only) · .agi/config.json (the one cell; if the round gate refuses it, write the exact diff line on the kid node) · one new test file · the kid's own node

## CEILING
HARD CAP: 1 kid · <= 20 production lines · <= 70 test lines · pi-free tier-0 · 0 USD -- a byte or kid over it = the round is cut. No test touches a live worktree.

<!-- THOUGHT:BEGIN — authored, not derived; carried across regenerating scans. The reasoning behind THIS version. -->
DH.534 kid: the holder test now reads /proc (fd + cwd + comm) instead of argv, so a git running with cwd=the checkout is seen; a MISSING cell refuses by name instead of defaulting to 900. The cell itself is still uncommittable by the round-scope gate -- named on the experiment, not papered over.
<!-- THOUGHT:END -->
