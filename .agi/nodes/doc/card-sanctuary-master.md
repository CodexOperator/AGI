# doc:card-sanctuary-master

# doc:card-sanctuary-master — sanctuary-master's card (council loop, goal:g7.16.1): the ONE scratch

Replaced whole, never appended; ≤ 100 lines; written DURING the work so a dead session is resumable.

## §0 State (08:5xZ 09-30, date -u) — gen 9 · resumed after the scrub · rotation near (meter 0.40 / 0.47)

|---|---|
| post | sanctuary-master: bundle reviewer + the directors' centralized BOARD COORDINATOR (owner 03:0xZ 09-30, verbatim: "And make sure the directors still know to do coordination through Sanctuary Master. Like DG1 is waiting in SM to know when they can continue. And that's perfect that's exactly the setup I want as SM acts as a centralized board coordinator while the council answers mid-work questions and clarifications."): sequencing, when to continue, board placement = me · rulings = the council · never the Prime |
| usage + stand-down | owner 06:1xZ 09-30, verbatim (via the Prime): "We should probably ease off expensive subagents now and just use strictly sonnet 5.5 ideally using our new headless CC review routes." → Sonnet 5.5 subagents ONLY, ≤ 2 at once, headless CC route where one exists, never Opus/Fable or the Claude Workflow tool · and: "We also will need to stand down director-general 5 and 6 to help conserve tokens as well. Just let them arrive at a stopping point and have them stop and take down the posts to free up resources. 3,4 can continue as is and pick up whatever 5,6 don't finish after standing down" → I re-lane DG5/DG6 handover rows onto DG3 + DG4 (priority: DG6 email scrub · DG5 ramdisk proof · g1.31 residues · workflow.py CC route) |

## §1 Plan
```
done   bundles 1-3 → bigger_outcome 1-3 v3 (1111fed58; 128 closed; conf 0.75 → 0.8 when skills/agi-stream :18 :21 are scrubbed by stream-master)
done   bundle 4 write.py chain 129-149 CLOSED · W2c B (g4.18.6.3.2) CLOSED · 128 engine CLOSED · grid fork · W-G
done   DG1 outcomes: g4.18.5.1 · g4.18.6.1 · g4.18.6.2 · g4.18.6.3.2 · g7.16.1.4.1
done   gen 9: DG6 placed on g1.31 (lane rule sent) · board A → DG5 (retire .5.5.3 → .5.5) · board B → DG4 (.5.3.2 + .1 under .5.2, one mover fn)
NOW    review sm9a (4 rounds) + Opus cross-checks → verdicts to DG3 / DG4 / DG5
       W2c C clean → full [ready] to DG1 → DG1 outcome(s) (+ g4.18.5.2 after .2.1/.2.2) → MY bundle-4 bigger_outcome → council
```

## §2 Landed this gen (CC opus runs 16-28 + by hand; details in each run's journal)
- runs 16-24: 131-147 opened/closed (THOUGHT marker ONE _HEAD/_END; stdin once; payload one pre-dry judge by VERB; dry == real)
- run 23: 128 engine b0bc1699f accept · run 26: DG4 cold homing 5a257979b (156 → 21a579ba1 by hand) · heal restarted 03:26:37Z, falsifier PASSED (5 homed, shmem +0M)
- run 27: DG5 keys 4abfee9d3 → 157-161 (DG5) · Prime writing key_template (cond 5 default = ruling)
- run 25/28: g4.18.1.6 (DG3) → 150-155; 150 151 155 MET in 563cd4ca9 → 162 163 (DG3, introduced by the move)
- by hand: 141 · 137 · 148+149 f0768720f · 6e21d9655 · grid 6ec1f046c · g7.16.1.4.1.2 · c3c118b3c (write.py HEAD red: DG4's 1098822e1 swept DG3's canonicalize; fixed)

## 🔴 Where it stops
```
Review of DG3 6894c783f3 (B alias-id regression fix + R1c splitlines forge fix) → /tmp/sm9/cc_b2.json. If a successor wakes and it is absent: re-run it (Sonnet Agent; reuse /tmp/sm9/e6p probes).
  on ACCEPT: DG3 closes g4.18.1.6 + g7.33.20 + g1.31.5.2 → bundle-4 limit (3) CLOSED → bigger_outcome council-bundle-4-one-gate-one-commit-ids-never-move: ONE update (limit 3 closed, cite DG2 verdict:dg2mvp-w2cD PROVED 0.86); stays 0.8 until (4a) = g4.18.5.5 (DG4.02 live) lands → then 0.9
ACCEPTED post-resume: 30175ea7e9 (anonymize email class, g1.31.5.1.2) · be11671cb (N2 residues; .5.5.4 + .5.5.8 COMPLETE)
OPEN RESIDUES: DG4 158c (2833cdae9, orphan key temp: adopt or sweep; closes .7.1.4.1) · DG3 hw-model class (dg6-03/04 murs re-running)
CONFIG (the Prime applies; I relay): g1.31.1.1 mode = the config.json 2 lines land WITH DG4's brief.py merge-up (the test at :1988 is updated there) · g1.31.2 skills entry = after DG4's 2 build nodes (exact text → Prime, byte_cap 6000→8000) · town fixed d5e6fd805
LANES: DG3 = write.py · anonymize/privacy · dispatch.py · RAM writers · render/viewport (.7.1.5 .7.2.7) · g1.31 node answers (46 rows) · .10.4 | DG4 = rotate.py · heal · adapters · keys · workflow.py + CC route · .7 (12 nodes) · .10.1 .10.2 .10.6 · the DG6 hook/harvest rows
MERGE-UPS expected: DG4.01 (write-refusal), DG4.02 (n83 + g4.18.5.5), DG3's dg6-0x rounds → gate per skill agi-master-gate, one [merge-up] per batch
First command at wake: ListAgents + tmux list-windows · shas before 08:0xZ are OLD: grep ^<old> /data/scrub/union.git/filter-repo/commit-map
```
## §4 Traps
| trap | rule |
|---|---|
| MAIN is shared by every post | commit by exact path; never switch branches, stash or reset |
| `grep -r` / `find` over .agi/ or the repo root io-stalls the box | `git grep PATTERN -- <paths>` |
| rotate flattens the quorum card | re-link: `ln -sfn ../../nodes/doc/card-sanctuary-master.md .agi/sessions/quorum/sanctuary-master.md` |
| a home path, a /data user dir name | never print it: count only (128 was found by counts) |
| suite lock held → write.py's self-commit refused | the write lands; commit by exact path in a background waiter loop |
| a post rotates mid-thread | its old session name dies or is reused by ANOTHER post: re-read config:posts before every send |
| a peer's commits land between a row's commits | one round per commit, never a range across a foreign commit |
| a mur residue chain | residues only on what THIS diff introduced or left open; the rest are notes |
| a claim that names a message ("prints X") | the round also checks the rc and what was written (C1) |
| a falsifier grep can pass on a spelling technicality | re-run it against the pre-fix SHA (113: `THOUGHT:(BEGIN|END)` dodged F2) |
| preview vs write | every write.py fix: ask for dry == real on rc AND stderr (96, 125, 130) |
| a bigger_outcome before the directors' outcomes | never: DG1 writes one OUTCOME per goal first |
| two sessions share a name after rotations | map tmux window ids → ListAgents @N; send with `name [ref]` |
| card stamps | read `date -u`, never estimate (DG1 stamped 09-30 at 23:5x 09-29) |
