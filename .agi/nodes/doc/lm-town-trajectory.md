title: "The local-maxxing town trajectory board — the ONE shared update space for the master and both directors (owner 01:2xZ 09-21): live rounds, queue per track, last merges, the engine batch; every post appends one line per landing, the master trims the body"

# doc:lm-town-trajectory — the local-maxxing TRAJECTORY (super node, to the side of the goal tree)
**What it is (owner 01:3xZ 09-21, verbatim on goal:g14):** "a super node that exists to the side and links into all relevant nodes that relate to it. It's bigger than a single sub goal and maybe sometimes bigger than a perpetual goal but smaller than a vision. An individual set of metrics we are trying to chase for this track. In our case we are hoping that layering all these techniques lets us run bigger and bigger existing models on smaller and smaller footprints with longer and longer [context] windows." **How it changes (owner 01:4xZ-01:5xZ):** metrics may be adjusted mid-research to test things or when adjustments are needed; each change is NOT a note — it is a new node version: overwrite this body in place (the grid records the version; the reason goes in the THOUGHT block); an A/B of a metric change = a branch worktree, overwrite vs control, both measured. The board below is updated the same way (replace the section, never append). A proper `trajectory` node type is queued (G14.14.5); until it lands this doc IS the node.

## The metrics chased (one row per measured point; newest first; every number on its node)
| date | model (params) | footprint | ctx line | tok/s | quality (battery) | how | node |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| target | bigger | smaller | longer | usable | within 10 pct of deepseek-v4.1-flash on HumanEval + IFEval — reference MEASURED 09-21: 93.9 pct HumanEval (154/164) · 0.869 IFEval strict (470/541) | layered: dead-head prune → context/throughput → fine-tune → QAT → telepathy | goal:g14.11 (the switch); experiment:a00-559ee702-d3c7dd |
| 09-20/21 | Bonsai 2 27B PTQ1_0 (27.36B, 1.75 bpw) | 7,268 MiB VRAM (8 GB rig) | 64K, 1 stream | 23.0 empty / 18.9 at 16.8K | HumanEval 86.6 pct = 92.2 pct of reference (FIRES 0.9x; C2 +LoRA 92.9); IFEval — (SWR.02) | ternary PTQ (shipped) | experiment:a00-bb10233d-5a7f1f · a00-559ee702-d3c7dd |
| 09-20 | Qwen3.5-9B Q4_K_M (9B) | 6,010 MiB | 64K | 62.68 (2.87 J/tok) | HumanEval 78.0 / 79.3 pct (A / A2) | Q4 (shipped) | experiment:a00-c4441397-c8a8c6 |

thought-master 02:2xZ 09-21 -- v4: Board section synced to every owner line of 01:1xZ-02:1xZ (G14.16, G14.7.2/3, G14.10.2, G14.14.5-8, magic pane layer, comms state); metric rows unchanged (owner: 'merge the update back and sync it so your docs properly reflect the updates').
